Your folder must also include a README.txt file documenting your process:
    Things that worked: The website functions, it takes an input city in a search box, and based on the city it calls
    components from the open weather api to display weather information on the screen.
Things that didn't work:
    We wanted to include our own icons for weather description, however, since we were calling icons from the weather api,
    we had to stick to their icon design.
Things that were harder/easier:
    Our team was new to api fetch, thus it was a learning process with open weather api which was harder at first but
    then we watched a bunch of youtube videos to educate ourselves. Easier part of the project was HTML and CSS.
